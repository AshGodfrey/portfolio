				<h3>Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Specialist role?</h3>

				<p class="description">
					I currently work as a Customer Success Manager for a start-up that assists non-profits fund raise with technology. This experience has made me adept at navigating the unique challenges of a working in fundraising, and at a start-up.
				</p>

				<p class="description"> 
					I also believe in making everything better, which is why I'd like to take the opportunity to point out a typo and display issue on the Raisely site <a href="https://www.raisely.com/page/pricing">here.</a> The relevant paragraph says this: "Raisely seamlessly integrates Stripe.com, which yo ucan setup in minutes. You can also connect&32;PayPal to take donations through One Touch payments."</p>

				<h3>Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</h3>

				<p class="description">
					 I love working in fundraising, so I was absolutely thrilled when I saw what Raisely did. I have a long track record of working towards greater social good, and working for "purpose not profit" is important for me as a person. What excites me even more is that Raisely's 0% fee, which is industry breaking in the United States. Knowing where my donation goes is important, and as a donor, I accept (but don't love) unstated donation fees.

				<h3>Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they’re good.  </h3>

				<p class="description">
					Though I often complain about Amazon Logistics delivery, I find Amazon's support to be top-notch. Amazon goes above and beyond to make problems with orders right (even when they're user error), whether that's refunding the cost, sending a free replacement or providing a credit for later deliveries. I almost always feel my issue was resolved in a satisfactory way after leaving Amazon support.
